# Indoor Air Quality Monitoring and Control System
## Data
This folder contains the data obtained from the system for around 10 days of operation, as well as a script to plot the data. 

The data at the beginning was not generated by fully automatic operation of the system, due to occasional updates and debugging of the programs. After 4 Jan, 2017 (as indicated by the date of the data entries), the system fully operated in automatic mode without human interventions.
